        <p>Hello! I'm Tatiana. I was born in Philadelphia, but my heart belongs on the west coast (happily lived  in Arizona for 6 months). I love design and being creative and enjoy going to art museums . One of my favorite artists is Johannes Vermeer and one of my favorite paintings is from the artist Diego Velazquez(Las Meninas).  </p>

        <p>Some facts about myself: I'm really shy. I don't like to take photos with just my face. I am especially shy about being on video. But I'm not shy about joining in on mosh pits and crowd surfing (I tend to confuse people). I used to be a photographer.. you can check out some of my work on my portfolio link. </p>
